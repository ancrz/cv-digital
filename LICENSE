CV-DIGITAL HYBRID RESTRICTIVE LICENSE
Version 1.0 — Effective Date: February 12, 2026

================================================================================

Copyright (c) 2026 ancrz. All Rights Reserved.

================================================================================

LEGAL NOTICE AND CONTEXT (CONTEXTO LEGAL)

This software is licensed under a HYBRID RESTRICTIVE LICENSE.
It combines the robust legal definitions of the Apache License 2.0 with specific
"Poison Pill" Clauses inspired by the "React/Facebook BSD+Patents" controversy
and the "Commons Clause" model, supplemented with comprehensive Intellectual
Property, Digital Assets, and Confidentiality provisions.

PURPOSE:

1.  To leverage the robust legal definitions of Apache 2.0.
2.  To STRICTLY PROHIBIT any commercial use (Educational/Portfolio Only).
3.  To enforce a "Litigation Termination" clause (Facebook Style) that revokes
    rights immediately upon any legal challenge or commercial misuse.
4.  To protect all proprietary Digital Assets, schemas, and architectural
    patterns embodied in the Software.
5.  To establish clear ownership of AI-assisted contributions.

================================================================================

1. DEFINITIONS

   1.1. "Software" means the CV Digital platform in its entirety, including
        but not limited to: source code, object code, compiled binaries,
        APIs, JSON schemas, configuration files, templates, UI/UX designs,
        workflow definitions, documentation, and any updates, modifications,
        or derivative works thereof.

   1.2. "Digital Assets" means all non-code proprietary materials included in
        or generated by the Software, including but not limited to: CV data
        structures, JSON schema definitions, i18n translation files, design
        system tokens, UI component patterns, print stylesheet configurations,
        ATS optimization patterns, and GitHub Actions workflows.

   1.3. "Portfolio Use" means access to and use of the Software strictly for
        learning, experimentation, education, portfolio demonstration, and
        development purposes. This explicitly excludes any Commercial Use as
        defined in Section 1.4.

   1.4. "Commercial Use" includes, but is not limited to:
        (a) Use of the Software in a production environment for profit;
        (b) Use of the Software to provide services to third parties (SaaS);
        (c) Integrating the Software into a product for which a fee is charged;
        (d) Selling, reselling, or white-labeling the Software or its patterns;
        (e) Use by any commercial entity for purposes other than internal
            evaluation/learning.

   1.5. "Confidential Information" means all non-public technical and business
        information embodied in the Software, including source code, algorithms,
        architectures, API designs, and any information marked or reasonably
        understood to be confidential.

   1.6. "Schema-Driven Architecture" means the proprietary development
        methodology employed by the Software, whereby a JSON data schema
        serves as the single source of truth, propagating through JavaScript
        rendering, i18n overlays, ATS print optimization, and responsive
        UI layers. This methodology and its specific implementation are
        proprietary to Licensor.

   1.7. "Licensor" means the copyright owner: ancrz.

   1.8. "Licensee" means any individual or entity accessing or using the
        Software.

   For all other definitions, the Standard Apache License 2.0 terms apply
   (see http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), EXCEPT where explicitly
   overridden by this Agreement.
